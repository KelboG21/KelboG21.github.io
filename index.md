# Kelsey Guerrero's Portfolio

I'm currently working on 2 majors here at CSUF. Those 2 majors are Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing and Pure Math (at the moment lol).
I intend to graduate with 2 degrees in the Fall of 2025 or Spring 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L labs.

Lab 1:
This was one of my favorite labs because things made sense at this point of time of the class. Obviously, it was somewhat difficult at the time since my partner and I haven't coded ever in our lives. But on the other hand, it was kind of fun to learn how to use the terminal and complete something new on the text editor. The down side of this lab, although it was the first lab of the semester, was realizing this lab class was going to be horrible.
When I say horrible, I mean horrible. Every Wednesday for the whole semester, I'm expected to walk into a lab with the lowest expectations that the TAs were going to help anyone and them to have this mindset that we miraculously know everything about coding. At times when we ask how are we structure a particular statement, they would say "You don't know how to do that?" Girl, thats why I'm here! For this lab in particular, we had completed it the second week of the semester but then we were told we all had to do it again on the third week of the third week because we didn't install Linux. How are we expected to complete this lab in the first place when no one had a computer with the Linux program and we are in a computer lab with computers that we can't use? The code isn't compliling with that logical error. I don't care if its rude, its a true fact and I'm unfortunately putting a portion of my $3,000 tuition to this was also unfortunate.

Lab 8:
Part of why this lab was one of my favorites was I got to work alone. It's not because I didn't get a partner in class, but had a family emergency to attend to. To a degree, this lab a bit confusing because of the complexity of the code. It tests your knowledge of using the if, for and bool statements of how to use them.

Lab 7:
This lab was another one of my favorite labs. Compared to the other 11 labs we worked on this semester, this was the best one I work on with a partner. Although my partner understood the TODOs of the lab more than myself, we used our strengths to help each other's weaknesses. With this lab, we had to utilize the if and else statements. While my partner wrote the majority of the code for this lab, I would catch the logical errors and other formatting errors. We got alot of logical errors towards the end because the conditions of the parking for that particular street was different from the other streets. This lab itself taught me to really pay attention to the structure of each statement to fit the operation we need to perform for each TODO.
